![GistMaster, a catalogue for your gists](docs/gistmaster.png)

Welcome to **GistMaster**, your self-updating catalogue for **Github Gists**!

This repository compiles my Gists automatically using Github Actions, keeping them organised in a well-structured and easy-to-browse format.

üëâ **[Check my Gists below](#gists)** to explore various code samples.

üßë‚Äçüíª If you like this, you can create your own catalogue! The project is designed to be easily reused by other Github users with minimal configuration, as explained in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide.
