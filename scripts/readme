<!-- ![GistMaster, a catalogue for your gists](docs/gistmaster.png) -->

Welcome to my **GistMaster**, your self-updating catalogue for my **Github Gists**!

This repository compiles my Gists automatically using Github Actions, keeping them organised in a well-structured and easy-to-browse format. Thanks to [@rjvitorino](https://github.com/rjvitorino/) for making this beautiful tool! If you want to make your own catalogue, check this [repo](https://github.com/rjvitorino/gists-catalogue/tree/main) out!

ðŸ‘‰ **[Check my Gists below](#gists)** to explore various code samples.

## About

ðŸ‘‹ I'm **[@{github_username}]({github_url})**, and my open-source contributions are available on my **[Github profile]({github_url})**.
In this repository, you will find random snippets and scripts I've created to live my lazy life and reduce busywork.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Explore my Gists below](#gists)** to see my work and discover _potentially_ useful code samples.
