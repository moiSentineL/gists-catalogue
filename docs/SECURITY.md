## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it through the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/rjvitorino/gists-catalogue/security/advisories).

Alternatively, you can report it via email to [hello <at> ricardovitorino <dot> com](mailto:hello@ricardovitorino.com). Please include the following details with your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any potential mitigations you have identified.
- Your contact information if you require further assistance.

I will try to respond to security reports within 48 hours and make every effort to quickly address the issue. 

## Security Measures

To ensure the security of our repository and its users, the following best practices are followed:

1. **Dependency Management**: Dependencies are regularly updated and tools like Dependabot are used to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in third-party packages.
2. **Code Reviews**: All code changes are subject to peer review to identify potential security issues.
3. **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions are used for continuous integration to run automated tests and checks on all pull requests.
4. **Least Privilege Principle**: Access to sensitive parts of the repository is limited to only those who need it.
5. **Static Code Analysis**: Tools like Ruff are used for linting and code analysis to enforce secure coding practices.
6. **Documentation**: Documentation is maintained up-to-date on secure coding practices and how to contribute securely.

## Responsible Disclosure

I believe in responsible disclosure and request that all security vulnerabilities be reported to us privately, allowing the opportunity to address them before they are disclosed publicly. I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and may ask for additional information or assistance as needed.

## Security Updates

Updates are regularly released to address security vulnerabilities. Users are encouraged to keep their installations up-to-date to benefit from these fixes. Announcements regarding security updates will be made on the repository's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rjvitorino/gists-catalogue/releases) page.

## Community Guidelines

I am committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive community. All members are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and to report any breaches that could impact the security or integrity of the project.
